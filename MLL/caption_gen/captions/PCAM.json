    "positive": [
        "1. The medical picture/histopathologic scans of positive in medical image classification reveal a cluster of abnormal cells with atypical nuclei and high mitotic activity. The cells show a high degree of pleomorphism and are positive for markers of aggressive cancer. The surrounding tissue appears to be infiltrated by the malignant cells.",
        "2. The medical picture/histopathologic scans of positive in medical image classification depict a tumor with a well-defined border and central necrosis. The tumor cells exhibit a high proliferative index and are positive for hormone receptors, suggesting a hormone-sensitive malignancy. The stroma surrounding the tumor shows signs of inflammation.",
        "3. The medical picture/histopathologic scans of positive in medical image classification show a dense collection of abnormal cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. The cells display a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and are arranged in a disorganized pattern. The tumor microenvironment is characterized by increased angiogenesis.",
        "4. The medical picture/histopathologic scans of positive in medical image classification reveal a malignant lesion with a high-grade nuclear features. The cells exhibit marked pleomorphism and hyperchromasia, indicative of aggressive cancer. The presence of mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies further supports the diagnosis of a high-grade malignancy.",
        "5. The medical picture/histopathologic scans of positive in medical image classification show a tumor composed of poorly differentiated cells with irregular nuclear contours and prominent nucleoli. The cells display brisk mitotic activity and are positive for markers of epithelial origin. The surrounding stroma is desmoplastic and infiltrated by inflammatory cells.",
        "6. The medical picture/histopathologic scans of positive in medical image classification depict a tumor with a high mitotic rate and areas of necrosis. The tumor cells exhibit marked cellular atypia and an infiltrative growth pattern. Immunohistochemical staining reveals positivity for markers specific to a particular type of cancer, confirming the diagnosis.",
        "7. The medical picture/histopathologic scans of positive in medical image classification reveal a malignant tumor with a high proliferation rate and invasive features. The tumor cells exhibit irregular nuclei and abundant mitotic figures, consistent with a high-grade malignancy. The tumor microenvironment shows signs of angiogenesis and inflammation.",
        "8. The medical picture/histopathologic scans of positive in medical image classification depict a lesion composed of cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The cells display a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and are arranged in a trabecular pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis confirms the presence of specific markers associated with a malignant tumor.",
        "9. The medical picture/histopathologic scans of positive in medical image classification show a tumor with sheets of highly pleomorphic cells and increased mitotic activity. The cells exhibit irregular nuclear contours and prominent nucleoli, indicative of an aggressive neoplasm. The tumor microenvironment is characterized by stromal fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltration.",
        "10. The medical picture/histopathologic scans of positive in medical image classification reveal a tumor with a high nuclear grade and brisk mitotic activity. The tumor cells exhibit marked atypia and irregular nuclear contours, consistent with a high-grade malignancy. The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes suggests an immune response against the malignant cells."
